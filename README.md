## 🚀 Features

- Multiple TTS models / scripts included (e.g. *Fast_DF_TTS.py*, *TTS_DF.py*, *TextToSpeech_B.py*, *TextToSpeech_Python.py*, *ttsB.py*)  
- Configurable speech synthesis (voice, speed, pitch, etc.)  
- Supports batch processing of multiple texts  
- Clean and modular code structure  
- Easy to extend or integrate into other applications

````

- **Fast_DF_TTS.py** — A faster (or optimized) implementation of a TTS pipeline  
- **TTS_DF.py** — Core TTS model / main logic  
- **TextToSpeech_B.py** — Alternate version / branch  
- **TextToSpeech_Python.py** — A pure-Python version or example  
- **ttsB.py** — A lightweight or utility script

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raheel2005-khan/TextToSpeech.git
   cd TextToSpeech
````

2. **Create / activate a Python virtual environment** (recommended)

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > If you don’t have a `requirements.txt`, create one listing required libraries (e.g. `torch`, `numpy`, `soundfile`, etc.).

## 🎯 Usage

Here is a basic usage example (you may adapt for your script):

```python
from Fast_DF_TTS import synthesize  # example import

text = "Hello, this is a demo of text to speech."
output_path = "output.wav"

synthesize(text, output_path)
print("Audio saved to:", output_path)
```

You can also run from CLI (if supported):

```bash
python Fast_DF_TTS.py "Hello, world!" output.wav
```

> Adjust according to the script names and argument style in your code.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You may have configurable options such as:

| Setting         | Description                     | Default       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `voice`         | Choice of speaker / voice model | e.g. `"male"` |
| `speed`         | Speech rate multiplier          | e.g. `1.0`    |
| `pitch`         | Pitch adjustment                | e.g. `0.0`    |
| `output_format` | WAV, MP3, etc.                  | `"wav"`       |

(You can move these to a config file or command-line arguments in your project.)

---

## 📂 Examples / Demo

Include some sample input → output pairs, e.g.:

* **Input:** “This is a sample text.”
* **Output audio file:** `sample_output.wav`

You could also embed a short audio clip or a link to a demo.

---

## ✅ Tests

(Optional) If you have tests:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

Include test files and test cases to ensure correctness of TTS output (e.g. waveform sanity, duration, etc.).
